"Define a GameLogic class in ten_thousand/game_logic.py file."

"can you add to the code: Handle calculating score for dice roll"

"Add calculate_score static method to GameLogic class."

"can you add more to code so it does this: The input to calculate_score is a tuple of integers that 
represent a dice roll. The output from calculate_score is an integer representing the rollâ€™s score according to rules of game."

"Handle rolling dice"

"Add roll_dice static method to GameLogic class."

"The input to roll_dice is an integer between 1 and 6."

"can you add something that does this: The output of roll_dice is a tuple with random values between 1 and 6. The length of tuple must match the argument given to roll_dice method."

"these are the tests we need to pass but so far only 20 are passing and 36 are failing, update code to pass all tests:"

"there are even more failed tests. these are the results: FAILED tests/test_calculate_score.py::test_single_five - IndexError: list index out of range..."

"add print to all areas of the code where needed:"

"there are no print messages or errors raised what does that mean"

"this is the current code: ..."

"here are the tests: ..."

"Let's modify the existing code to pass the provided requirements for testing both rolling dice and calculating scores."

"add in line text to explain what this is doing line by line:"

"explain this further what is this doing: score += counts[0] * (counts[0] // 3) * (100 * (counts[0] % 3))"

"add all this as in line code"

"rewrite the code to use the Counter() function and randomint() function"

"the straght scoring is wrong because the exected is 1500 but code is saying 150:"

"can you refactor this code?"
